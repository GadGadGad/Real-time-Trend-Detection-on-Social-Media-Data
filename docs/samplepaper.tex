\begin{abstract}
    In the era of information overload, rapidly detecting and understanding social trends is crucial for public safety and market intelligence. 
    However, current methods struggle with the "Semantic Ambiguity" of social posts and the "Evaluation Gap" in unlabelled streaming data. 
    This report presents a comprehensive \textbf{Real-time Event Detection System} using a novel \textbf{Social-Aware Hierarchical Clustering (SAHC)} strategy. 
    We introduce a \textbf{Dual-Path Architecture} that combines Spark/Kafka for low-latency alerts with asynchronous LLM workers for deep semantic reasoning. 
    Experimental results on a \textbf{Mini-Ground Truth} subset (N=300 manually labeled social posts) show our \textbf{full hybrid pipeline} achieves \textbf{NMI = 0.598}. . 
    On the full dataset of 7,605 items, we report intrinsic clustering metrics (Silhouette, Davies--Bouldin, noise ratio) and an \textbf{LLM-as-a-Judge} framework to evaluate semantic coherence at scale.
    Furthermore, we introduce a \textbf{"Mini-Ground Truth"} protocol and an \textbf{LLM-as-a-Judge} framework to rigorously evaluate cluster coherence, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional implementations.

\section{Introduction}
Social media platforms have become the primary source of real-time information. However, processing this data presents unique challenges: (1) \textbf{High Noise Ratio:} Valid news is often buried under spam and daily chatter (e.g., "Lottery results", "Weather"); (2) \textbf{Semantic Ambiguity:} Different communities use vastly different vocabularies to describe the same event (e.g., "Typhoon Yagi" vs. "Storm No. 3"); and (3) \textbf{Lack of Verification:} Viral rumors spread faster than factual corrections.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/dashboard.png}
    \caption{System Dashboard: Real-time visualization of trending events and their sentiment.} \label{fig:dashboard}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dashboard}, the system dashboard integrates three key views: (1) A real-time ranked list of trending events; (2) A time-series chart tracking sentiment evolution; and (3) A geospatial map highlighting event hotspots. This interface allows stakeholders to quickly grasp the "What, Where, and How" of emerging issues.

To tackle the challenges of Noise and Ambiguity, we introduce a \textbf{Dual-Path Architecture} that separates detection from analysis. This design allows us to catch viral trends in seconds (via the Fast Path) while preserving the deep semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Slow Path, effectively solving the classic "Latency vs. Accuracy" dilemma.

Our specific contributions include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A \textbf{Dual-Path Architecture} balancing < 10s latency for detection and deep LLM reasoning for insight.
    \item A \textbf{Social-Aware Hierarchical Clustering (SAHC)} algorithm using news anchors to reduce noise by ~50\%.
    \item A rigorous evaluation using both a \textbf{Mini-Ground Truth} dataset (N=300) and \textbf{LLM-as-a-Judge} metrics.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
Event detection has evolved from statistical methods to neural approaches. Early works relied on term-frequency analysis (TF-IDF) and topic modeling (LDA), which are fast but struggle with short, noisy social texts \cite{ref_bm25}.
Recent approaches leverage Deep Learning, specifically Transformer-based embeddings (BERT) \cite{ref_bert}, to capture semantic meaning. However, these methods often incur high latency, making them unsuitable for real-time streaming \cite{ref_sbert}.
Our work bridges this gap by using a density-based clustering algorithm (HDBSCAN) \cite{ref_hdbscan} on top of lightweight embeddings, achieving both speed and semantic depth.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Large Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation}
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Gemini have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) by demonstrating emergent reasoning capabilities. Built upon the Transformer architecture \cite{ref_bert}, these models utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in textual data.
\begin{equation}
    Attention(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\end{equation}
Despite their prowess, LLMs suffer from "hallucinations"—generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. To mitigate this in domain-specific applications, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is employed. RAG enhances the generative process by conditioning the LLM on retrieved relevant documents $D = \{d_1, ..., d_k\}$ before generating a response $y$:
\begin{equation}
    P(y|x) = \sum_{z \in D} P(z|x)P(y|x,z)
\end{equation}
In our system, we adapt this paradigm by treating "Clusters" as the retrieved context $z$, grounding the LLM's summarization in verified social data points.

\subsection{Real-time Streaming Architectures}
Modern event detection requires handling data with high velocity and volume. The \textbf{Kappa Architecture} simplifies the traditional Lambda Architecture by treating everything as a stream, utilizing a robust log-based message broker like Apache Kafka.
Kafka partitions data across distributed brokers, ensuring fault tolerance and high throughput. Consumers read data from these partitions using offsets $O$, maintaining exactly-once processing guarantees:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Lag}(t) = \text{Offset}_{produce}(t) - \text{Offset}_{consume}(t)
\end{equation}
For processing, \textbf{Spark Structured Streaming} treats live data streams as an unbounded input table. It processes textual data in micro-batches (e.g., 200ms intervals), enabling the application of batch-like operations (such as aggregations and joins) on streaming data with minimal latency overhead.

\subsection{Density-Based Clustering (HDBSCAN)}
Unlike centroid-based methods (K-Means) which assume spherical clusters, Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) \cite{ref_hdbscan} identifies clusters of varying densities and shapes.
HDBSCAN relies on a transformed distance metric to separate sparse noise from dense clusters. The \textbf{Core Distance} of a point $p$, denoted as $d_{core}(p)$, is defined as the distance to its $k$-th nearest neighbor. To ensure potential clusters are robust, the \textbf{Mutual Reachability Distance} between points $p$ and $q$ is formalized as:
\begin{equation}
    d_{mreach}(p, q) = \max \{ d_{core}(p), d_{core}(q), d(p, q) \}
\end{equation}
This metric effectively "pushes" sparse points away from each other. A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is then constructed using $d_{mreach}$ as edge weights. By iteratively removing edges with the highest weight, HDBSCAN builds a hierarchy of connected components, extracting stable clusters that persist over a wide range of density thresholds. This property is crucial for social media data, where event clusters ("Viral Trends") typically exhibit much higher density than background noise ("Daily Chatter").

\subsection{Event Taxonomy and Categorization}
To ensure actionable insights, we move beyond binary sentiment to a usage-based taxonomy (T1-T7), categorizing events by their value to specific stakeholders:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{T1. Crisis \& Public Risk} (Target: Emergency Services)\\
          \emph{Core Question: Is immediate intervention required?} Covers accidents, disasters, and riots.

    \item \textbf{T2. Policy Signal} (Target: Government)\\
          \emph{Core Question: How is the public reacting to new policies?} Covers new laws and official statements.

    \item \textbf{T3. Reputation Risk} (Target: PR Agencies)\\
          \emph{Core Question: Is public trust being damaged?} Covers scandals, boycotts, and controversies.

    \item \textbf{T4. Market Opportunity} (Target: Marketing Teams)\\
          \emph{Core Question: Is there monetizable demand?} Covers viral products and emerging lifestyle trends.

    \item \textbf{T5. Cultural Trend} (Target: Content Creators)\\
          \emph{Core Question: Is this trend worth riding for attention?} Covers memes and entertainment events.

    \item \textbf{T6. Operational Pain Point} (Target: Service Operators)\\
          \emph{Core Question: What are people complaining about?} Covers traffic, outages, and service failures.

    \item \textbf{T7. Routine/Noise} (Target: System Filter)\\
          \emph{Core Question: Should this be filtered?} Covers daily weather, routine sports, and lottery results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed System Architecture}
The system employs a specific variant of the Lambda Architecture, separated into two distinct processing paths to handle the "Latency vs. Accuracy" trade-off.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/full_pipeline.png}
    \caption{Proposed System Architecture: Dual-Path Processing (Fast Path vs. Slow Path).} \label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:pipeline} illustrates the end-to-end data flow. Raw data is ingested via Kafka, processed in micro-batches by Spark (Fast Path), and asynchronously enriched by Gemini Pro (Slow Path) before being served to the UI. This separation ensures that the heavy inference time of LLMs does not block the high-throughput ingestion pipeline.

\subsection{System Workflow}
The lifecycle of a social post in our system follows five stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Ingestion Layer:} Python crawlers, orchestrated by \textbf{Airflow}, continuously collect raw text from 40+ high-traffic Fanpages. Data is normalized to JSON format and pushed to the \textbf{Apache Kafka} topic \texttt{posts\_stream\_v1}, with \textbf{Zookeeper} handling cluster coordination.
    \item \textbf{Filtering (Spark Streaming):} The \textbf{Spark} engine consumes the Kafka stream in micro-batches. A Heuristic Guard drops routine noise, while a \textbf{Smart Query Constructor} expands potential trend keywords (e.g., "Sea Games" $\to$ "Sea Games 33 Schedule") to increase recall.
    \item \textbf{Clustering (Fast Path):} Valid social posts are vectorized using ONNX models and \textbf{matched to Anchor vectors} (News/Trends) using a \textbf{hybrid score} (vector + keyword + rerank). Posts that fail the threshold are buffered as \textit{residual} for the \textbf{Discovery} step (HDBSCAN).
    \item \textbf{Intelligence (Slow Path):} Asynchronous \textbf{Python Workers} poll confirmed clusters from the \textbf{PostgreSQL} unified store. They query \textbf{Gemini Pro} to extract structured 5W1H summaries and deduplicate overlapping topics (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:prompt_refinement}).
    \item \textbf{Visualization:} The Dashboard polls the PostgreSQL database to display verified, enriched events in real-time.
\end{enumerate}

            \vspace{0.2cm}
            \par
            To illustrate the pipeline, consider a single social post lifecycle:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Input:} Crawler fetches raw text "Bão số 3 giật cấp 12..." from fanpage \textit{ThongTinChinhPhu}.
                \item \textbf{Ingestion:} Kafka producer serializes it to JSON and pushes to topic \texttt{posts\_stream\_v1} (Partition 0).
                \item \textbf{Filtration:} Spark Streaming consumes the message. The Heuristic Guard permits it, and Smart Query expands context to "Typhoon Yagi tracking".
                \item \textbf{Clustering:} The Onnx Worker maps it to vector $\mathbf{v}$. SAHC identifies the nearest News Anchor "Typhoon Yagi" (Similarity $> 0.85$) and attaches the post.
                \item \textbf{Intelligence:} The cluster grows beyond the significance threshold. An async worker triggers Gemini Pro, which returns a structured summary: "Typhoon Yagi approaching Quang Ninh."
                \item \textbf{Output:} The Dashboard receives the specific update and displays a "Public Risk" alert on the live map.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{minipage}%
    }
\end{center}

\subsection{Fast Path vs. Slow Path Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ingestion (Kafka \& Zookeeper):}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textbf{Producer:} Serializes raw posts into JSON and publishes to the \texttt{posts\_stream\_v1} topic, handling retries and exponential backoff to ensure at-least-once delivery.
              \item \textbf{Broker:} Kafka acts as the distributed, fault-tolerant log storage, while \textbf{ZooKeeper} manages broker metadata, leader election, and partition assignment.
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Processing (Spark Structured Streaming):}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Consumes events from Kafka with \textbf{exactly-once semantics} using checkpointing.
              \item Parses raw JSON payloads into Spark DataFrames for efficient columnar processing.
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Inference (Pandas UDF \& ONNX):}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Uses PySpark’s \textbf{Pandas UDF} interface to vectorize text in batches, avoiding row-by-row Python serialization overhead.
              \item Invokes the \textbf{ONNX Runtime} engine on Worker nodes to compute embeddings (SBERT) for each micro-batch; \textbf{HDBSCAN} is triggered only on the \textit{unmatched/residual} set to discover emerging \textbf{Social-only} events.
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Slow Path Intelligence (Async Workers):}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Designed to decouple heavy operations from the ingestion stream. Workers poll confirmed clusters and:
                  \begin{enumerate}
                      \item Query \textbf{Google Trends API} to fetch search volume (G-score), using the filter prompt in Appendix Table \ref{tab:prompt_trends}. This is asynchronous because search interest often requires time to accumulate ("stack up") before becoming significant, making it a lagging signal compared to instant social bursts, alongside API rate constraints.
                      \item Employ a \textbf{Context-Aware Prompting} strategy with Gemini Pro to synthesize coherent summaries.
                  \end{enumerate}
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Latency Definition}
We distinguish between two types of latency in our system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fast-Path Processing Latency:} measured from Kafka ingestion to cluster assignment within a Spark micro-batch.
    \item \textbf{End-to-End Alert Latency:} measured from data ingestion to dashboard update.
\end{itemize}

In our experimental setup, the Fast Path achieves an average processing latency of \textbf{2.4 seconds}, while the end-to-end alert latency remains \textbf{below 10 seconds}, as the Slow Path LLM enrichment is executed asynchronously and does not block real-time event detection.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Formal Problem Definition}
Let $\mathcal{S} = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\}$ be a continuous stream of social media posts, where each post $p_t$ at time $t$ is a tuple $(u_t, \tau_t, \textbf{v}_t)$, representing the user, timestamp, and semantic embedding vector respectively.
The goal of real-time event detection is to map this stream into a set of disjoint clusters $\mathcal{C} = \{C_1, C_2, ..., C_k\}$, where each cluster $C_i$ represents a real-world event.
A valid event cluster $C_i$ must satisfy two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cohesion:} $\forall p_a, p_b \in C_i, \text{sim}(\textbf{v}_a, \textbf{v}_b) \geq \theta_{sim}$
    \item \textbf{Impact:} $|C_i| \geq \delta_{min}$, where $|C_i|$ is the number of distinct users discussing the event.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing and Normalization}

To ensure high-quality input for the clustering engine, raw data from both paths undergoes specific preprocessing steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fast Path (Social Speed):} Given the high-throughput nature of social streams, we apply minimal, latency-optimized cleaning:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Heuristic Filtering:} We discard posts with length $<20$ characters (insufficient semantic context for embedding) or $>800$ characters (high likelihood of marketing spam or irrelevant boilerplate), and remove known "credit" patterns (e.g., "cre:", "via:") which do not contribute to event identity.
        \item \textbf{Unicode Normalization:} Converting all text to NFC format and lowercasing to handle Vietnamese diacritics consistently.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Slow Path (News Precision):} News data, used as high-confidence anchors, undergoes deep structural parsing:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Structural Extraction:} We use Regex to separate metadata (Author, Date, Location) from the body content, ensuring only the core narrative affects the centroid.
        \item \textbf{Alias Injection (Thesaurus):} To bridge the vocabulary gap between formal news and informal social posts, we inject known aliases into news vectors (e.g., mapping "Typhoon No. 3" $\to$ "Typhoon Yagi").
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Social-Aware Hierarchical Clustering (SAHC)}

Standard clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) often fails on social data due to noise. SAHC operates in three phases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1: News Anchoring.} We first cluster verified News articles to form "Anchor Centroids". These represent high-confidence events.
    \item \textbf{Phase 2: Social Attachment.} Incoming social posts are mapped to these anchors using Cosine Similarity.
    \item \textbf{Phase 3: Social Discovery.} Posts that do not match any anchor undergo a second pass of density-based clustering (HDBSCAN) to detect "Social-Only" trends (unreported by news).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/clustering_pipeline.png}
    \caption{Social-Aware Hierarchical Clustering (SAHC) Workflow.} \label{fig:clustering}
\end{figure}

The SAHC process is visualized in Fig. \ref{fig:clustering}. News articles first establish "Anchor" centroids (Blue nodes). Incoming Social posts (Green nodes) are then attracted to these anchors based on semantic similarity. Residual noise is finally filtered or clustered into new events by HDBSCAN, effectively reducing spam.

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{SAHC-A: Anchor-First Dual-Path Event Detection}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \Require Incoming micro-batch $B$, Active Anchors $\mathcal{A}$, Global Residual Buffer $\mathcal{G}$

        \State \textbf{// Path 1: Anchor Matching (Fast Path)}
        \For{each post $p \in B$}
            \State $\mathbf{v}_p \leftarrow \text{Encoder}(p_{text})$
            \State $a^* \leftarrow \arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \text{HybridSim}(p, a)$
            \State $score \leftarrow \text{HybridSim}(p, a^*)$ \Comment{Cos + Keyword}

            \EndIf
        \EndFor

        \State \textbf{// Path 2: Social Discovery (Slow Path)}
        \State $\mathcal{G} \leftarrow \mathcal{G} \cup \mathcal{R}_{batch}$ \Comment{Merge with global buffer}
        \If{$|\mathcal{G}| \ge N_{min\_clustering}$}
            \State $\mathcal{C}_{new} \leftarrow \text{HDBSCAN}(\mathcal{G}, \min_{pts}=5, \epsilon=0.3)$
            \For{each cluster $c \in \mathcal{C}_{new}$}
                \If{$|c| \ge \delta_{significant}$}
                    \State Initialize new Event $E_{new}$ from $c$
                    \State Remove points in $c$ from $\mathcal{G}$
                \EndIf
            \EndFor
            \State Prune old points from $\mathcal{G}$ \Comment{Time-decay cleanup}
        \EndIf
        
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Hybrid Matching Strategy:} To satisfy both semantic understanding and precision, we employ a composite score:
\begin{equation}
    Score = \underbrace{\text{Vector Similarity}}_{\text{Semantic Context}} + \underbrace{\text{Keyword Match}}_{\text{Exact Entity}}
\end{equation}
This hybrid approach balances recall and precision: \textbf{Vector Similarity} captures semantic nuances (e.g., matching "typhoon" with "storm"), while \textbf{Keyword Match} enforces exact entity alignment (e.g., distinguishing "Storm Yagi" from "Storm Koto"), preventing valid but distinct events from being merged.

\subsection{Trend Scoring Logic}
To determine which events are "Trending", we calculate a Unified Trend Score ($T$) for each cluster based on three weighted signals:
\begin{equation}
    T = 0.4 \cdot G + 0.35 \cdot N + 0.25 \cdot F
\end{equation}
Where the components represent:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{G (Google Search Volume):} The normalized search interest score from Google Trends, serving as a leading indicator of public curiosity.
    \item \textbf{N (News Volume):} The count of distinct mainstream news clusters linked to this event.
    \item \textbf{F (Facebook Engagement):} The weighted sum of interactions ($Likes + 2 \cdot Comments + 3 \cdot Shares$).
\end{itemize}
To handle the power-law distribution of social data, each component is normalized using a \textbf{Log-Min-Max} scale before weighting:
\begin{equation}
    S_{component} = 100 \cdot \frac{\log_{10}(1 + v)}{\log_{10}(1 + v_{max})}
\end{equation}
Where $v$ is the raw value and $v_{max}$ is an empirical ceiling ($G_{max}=10^6$, $N_{max}=10$, $F_{max}=2\cdot10^4$). Specifically for Facebook ($F$), interactions are weighted: $v_F = Likes + 2 \cdot Comments + 3 \cdot Shares$. This ensures that high-engagement events are categorized correctly even with low volume. A cluster is promoted to the dashboard only if $T > Threshold$.

\section{Data and Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Data Sources}
Our system monitors two primary data streams, unified into a common schema for processing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Social Media (Facebook):} Collected from high-engagement Fanpages (e.g., Theanh28, ThongTinChinhPhu). Data fields include: \texttt{pageName}, \texttt{postId}, \texttt{time} (ISO-8601), \texttt{text} content, and engagement metrics (\texttt{likes}, \texttt{comments}, \texttt{shares}).
    \item \textbf{Mainstream News:} Articles crawled from verified outlets (VnExpress, Tuoi Tre). Key fields: \texttt{ArticleID}, \texttt{URL}, \texttt{Title}, \texttt{Content}, and \texttt{PublishTime}.
    \item \textbf{Google Trends:} Real-time search keywords acting as "Leading Signals" to guide the initial filtering and prioritization of social clusters.
\end{itemize}
The experimental dataset consists of \textbf{7,605 unique items} collected from Dec 8 to Dec 22, 2025, including 
\textbf{4,644 mainstream news articles (61.1\%)} serving as high-confidence anchor signals, and 
\textbf{2,961 social media posts (38.9\%)} representing the noisy input stream.


\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}
Table \ref{tab:data_dist} presents the distribution of our experimental dataset. We observed a significant "Availability Gap": while we crawled over 9,400 news URLs, only \textbf{4,603 articles (48.6\%)} contained extractable body text, whereas \textbf{social media posts (2,981 items)} achieved near 100\% availability.
Furthermore, there is a structural divergence: News articles average $>500$ words with formal grammar, while social posts average $<50$ words with frequent slang. This dichotomy necessitates our "Dual-Path" design, where the \textbf{Fast Path} handles the high-velocity, short-text social stream, and the \textbf{Slow Path} leverages LLMs to synthesize the deeper context found in news anchors.

\begin{table}
    \caption{Dataset Distribution and Availability}\label{tab:data_dist}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l c c c}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Source Type} & \textbf{Crawled URLs} & \textbf{Valid Content} & \textbf{Avg Length (words)} \\
        \midrule
        Mainstream News      & $\approx 9,400$       & 4,603 (48.6\%)         & $> 500$                     \\
        Social Media         & $\approx 3,000$       & 2,981 (99.4\%)         & $< 50$                      \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Deployment and Operational Environment}
To ensure reproducibility and scalability, the system is containerized using \textbf{Docker Compose} with the following core services:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Software Stack:} Apache Kafka 7.5.0, Apache Spark 3.5.0, PostgreSQL 15, MongoDB 6.0.
    \item \textbf{Hardware:} Optimized for single-node deployment (8GB RAM, 4 vCPUs) or Kubernetes clustering.
    \item \textbf{Inference:} ONNX Runtime acceleration on NVIDIA T4 GPUs.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Deployment Benefits}
The containerized microservices architecture offers three key advantages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The decoupling of Ingestion (Kafka) and Processing (Spark/LLM) allows independent scaling. During high-traffic events (e.g., storms), we can horizontally add Spark Workers without reconfiguring the ingestion layer.
    \item \textbf{Cost Efficiency:} By offloading heavy batch clustering to local commodity hardware (CPU) and only invoking the paid LLM API for verified clusters (0.01\% of volume), we reduce operational costs by approx. 400x compared to pure LLM-based approaches.
    \item \textbf{Reproducibility:} The entire stack is defined in \texttt{docker-compose.yml}, ensuring that the "Demo" environment is identical to "Production", eliminating "it works on my machine" issues.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dataset Construction Strategy}
To train our specialized models without incurring high labeling costs, we employed a \textbf{Hybrid Labeling Strategy}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Self-Supervised Learning:} For the Cross-Encoder Reranker, we mined "Hard Negatives" (similar keywords but different semantics) to create 877 high-quality pairs.
    \item \textbf{Active Learning with LLM:} For Sentiment and Taxonomy classification, we used Gemini Pro to pseudo-label roughly 10k samples, then manually reviewed low-confidence scores. This yielded \textbf{4,630 samples for Sentiment} and \textbf{3,687 samples for Taxonomy} training.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model Selection and Fine-tuning}
We fine-tuned specific models for Vietnamese to serve as the system's backbone. To ensure robustness, we constructed a \textbf{Stress Test Set} containing 20 hard samples per category, specifically targeting edge cases such as "Slang" (social media language), "Storm Synonyms" (ambiguous event naming), and "Domain Overlap". Table \ref{tab:training_config} details the specific training hyperparameters used, and Table \ref{tab:models} shows the final performance metrics on this rigorous test set.

\end{figure}



Fig. \ref{fig:benchmark} compares the stability (gap between positive/negative pairs) of 5 state-of-the-art models. We define the Stability Gap mathematically as:
\begin{equation}
    Gap = Sim(q, pos) - Sim(q, neg)
\end{equation}
\texttt{vietnamese-document-embedding} (blue bar) consistently maintains the largest margin across edge cases like "Storm Synonyms" and "Slang", validating its selection as our backbone model.

Results showed that \texttt{dangvantuan/vietnamese-document-embedding} achieved the best stability (Avg Gap 0.265). Table \ref{tab:embedding_benchmark} details the performance across specific linguistic challenges, defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Avg Gap:} The mean stability margin across all test cases.
    \item \textbf{Storm:} Ability to group diverse storm names (e.g., "Typhoon Yagi", "Storm No.3").
    \item \textbf{Domain:} Cross-domain retrieval (e.g., matching "Healthcare" query to "Hospital" posts).
    \item \textbf{Category:} Distinguishing between event types (e.g., "Flood" vs. "Traffic Jam").
    \item \textbf{Slang:} Handling Vietnamese teen-code and internet slang (e.g., "bão" vs "b4o").
    \item \textbf{Abbrev:} Resolving common abbreviations (e.g., "HCM" $\rightarrow$ "Ho Chi Minh City").
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Analysis:} While \texttt{vn-sbert} excels at keyword-heavy tasks like "Storm" grouping (Gap: 0.355), it fails completely on "Slang" (-0.005), indicating it treats slang as noise. In contrast, \texttt{vn-doc-embedding} maintains robust performance on "Slang" (0.283) and "Abbrev" (0.419), making it the superior choice for processing raw social media text where informal language is prevalent.

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Clustering Algorithm Selection}
We compared our SAHC approach (using HDBSCAN core) against baselines. HDBSCAN was chosen for its superior Noise handling and Balance.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/trend_tsne.png}
    \caption{t-SNE Visualization of Event Clusters. Colors represent distinct events isolated by the algorithm.} \label{fig:tsne}
\end{figure}

The t-SNE projection in Fig. \ref{fig:tsne} demonstrates the effectiveness of our clustering. Distinct events (colored clusters) are well-separated in the semantic space, while noise points (gray) are scattered and effectively isolated by the algorithm.

\begin{table}
    \caption{Clustering Method Comparison}\label{tab:clustering_select}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l c c c c c}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Method}             & \textbf{Clusters (k)} & \textbf{Noise Pts} & \textbf{Silh. Score} ($\uparrow$) & \textbf{DB Index} ($\downarrow$) & \textbf{Time} ($\downarrow$) \\
        \midrule
        K-Means                     & 253                   & 0                  & 0.024                & 3.177             & 8.45s          \\
        \textbf{HDBSCAN (Baseline)} & \textbf{460}          & 1,984              & 0.109                & \textbf{2.094}    & 16.00s         \\
        BERTopic                    & 223                   & 1,801              & 0.112                & 2.363             & 55.72s         \\
        \textbf{SAHC (Ours)}        & \textbf{315}          & \textbf{985}       & \textbf{0.135}       & \textbf{1.951}    & \textbf{18.4s} \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Analysis:} As shown in Table \ref{tab:clustering_select}, \textbf{K-Means} proved unsuitable for social streaming data as it forces all noise into clusters. \textbf{Baseline HDBSCAN}, while correctly identifying noise, suffered from \textbf{over-fragmentation} (460 clusters) and excessive data rejection (1,984 noise points), often breaking single events into multiple micro-clusters.
Our \textbf{SAHC} approach resolves this by using News Anchors to "bridge" these micro-clusters. This successfully condensed the space into \textbf{315 coherent events} and recovered $\approx 50\%$ of the valid data previously discarded as noise (Noise reduced to 985), significantly boosting the Silhouette Score to \textbf{0.135}.

\subsection{Quantitative Evaluation (Mini-Ground Truth)}
All label-based clustering metrics (NMI, Purity, BCubed-F1, Entropy) are computed exclusively on the Mini-Ground Truth subset (N=300), as the full dataset does not contain human-annotated event labels.
Table \ref{tab:minigt} reports the performance of our \textbf{default SAHC setting}, while Table \ref{tab:ablation} further shows that the \textbf{full hybrid pipeline} (adding anchoring and LLM refinement) improves NMI from 0.54 to \textbf{0.5978}.

\begin{table}
    \caption{Performance on Mini-Ground Truth (N=300) -- Base SAHC Setting}\label{tab:minigt}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l c l}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Interpretation}                   \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{NMI} ($\uparrow$)    & \textbf{0.54}  & Good mutual information with human labels \\
        Purity ($\uparrow$)          & 0.65           & High dominant class consistency           \\
        BCubed-F1 ($\uparrow$)       & 0.35           & Balanced precision/recall for clustering  \\
        Entropy ($\downarrow$)       & 4.85           & Lower entropy indicates purer clusters    \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Metric Definitions:} To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we selected metrics that cover different aspects of clustering quality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Normalized Mutual Information (NMI):} Measures the alignment between cluster labels $Y$ and ground truth $C$:
          \begin{equation}
              NMI(Y, C) = \frac{2 \cdot I(Y; C)}{H(Y) + H(C)}
          \end{equation}
          Where $I$ is mutual information and $H$ is entropy.
    \item \textbf{Purity:} Quantifies the dominance of the majority class in each cluster:
          \begin{equation}
              Purity(\Omega, C) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_k \max_j |\omega_k \cap c_j|
          \end{equation}
          Where $N$ is total data points, $\Omega = \{\omega_1, ..., \omega_k\}$ is the set of clusters, and $C = \{c_1, ..., c_j\}$ is the set of ground truth classes.
    \item \textbf{Entropy:} Measures the homogeneity of a cluster (lower is better):
          \begin{equation}
              E(C) = - \sum_{k} \frac{n_k}{n} \log_2 \frac{n_k}{n}
          \end{equation}
          Where $n_k$ is the number of points in cluster $k$. A value close to 0 implies the cluster contains only a single class of events.
    \item \textbf{BCubed-F1:} An element-wise metric that balances cluster homogeneity and completeness. It is the harmonic mean of:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textit{BCubed Precision ($P_{b^3}$):} Average per-item precision. For each item $x$, it calculates the fraction of items in $x$'s cluster $C(x)$ that share the same class label $L(x)$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        P_{b^3} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{x \in X} \frac{|C(x) \cap L(x)|}{|C(x)|}
                    \end{equation}
              \item \textit{BCubed Recall ($R_{b^3}$):} Average per-item recall. For each item $x$, it calculates the fraction of items in $x$'s class $L(x)$ that are grouped into the same cluster $C(x)$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        R_{b^3} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{x \in X} \frac{|C(x) \cap L(x)|}{|L(x)|}
                    \end{equation}
          \end{itemize}
          \begin{equation}
              F1_{b^3} = 2 \cdot \frac{P_{b^3} \cdot R_{b^3}}{P_{b^3} + R_{b^3}}
          \end{equation}
          Unlike purity, BCubed penalizes both over-merging (low Precision) and over-fragmentation (low Recall).
    \item \textbf{Silhouette Score:} Quantifies how well an object fits its own cluster versus the nearest neighbor cluster:
          \begin{equation}
              S(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max\{a(i), b(i)\}}
          \end{equation}
          Where $a(i)$ is the mean intra-cluster distance and $b(i)$ is the mean nearest-cluster distance. $S \in [-1, 1]$, where values closer to 1 indicate dense, well-separated clusters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Batch Evaluation and Component Analysis}
To quantify the contribution of each module, we conduct an ablation study on the \textbf{Mini-Ground Truth} subset (N=300), where label-based metrics (NMI, BCubed-F1, Entropy) are well-defined.
Table \ref{tab:ablation} shows that progressively adding anchoring and LLM refinement improves clustering agreement with human labels.

\begin{table}
    \caption{Ablation Study on Mini-Ground Truth (N=300)}\label{tab:ablation}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l c c c}
        \toprule

        \midrule
        Baseline (HDBSCAN only)       & 0.53                      & 0.31                            & 4.91                            \\
        \textbf{Full Hybrid Pipeline} & \textbf{0.5978}           & \textbf{0.3821}                 & \textbf{4.4178}                 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis: LLM-as-a-Judge}
Traditional metrics like Silhouette Score often fail to capture semantic coherence. To address this, we implemented an \textbf{LLM-as-a-Judge} protocol, where a strong instruction-tuned model (Gemini Pro) acts as a proxy for human evaluation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Protocol:} The LLM is provided with a cluster's content and asked two questions: (1) "Does this cluster describe a single, distinct event?" (Topic Consistency, rated 0-1), and (2) Given two conflicting clusters, "Which one is more coherent?" (Pairwise Win-Rate).
    \item \textbf{Prompting:} We employ a "Role-Play" strategy where the LLM acts as an expert news editor. The full prompt specification is provided in Appendix Table \ref{tab:prompt_eval}.
\end{itemize}
Using this framework, we evaluated 100 random clusters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clear Events (e.g., "Middle East Conflict"):} Achieved \textbf{Consistency $\approx$ 1.0} and high Win-Rates.
    \item \textbf{Mixed/Noisy Clusters:} Correctly flagged by the LLM with significantly lower scores (0.64), validating the metric's utility for automated quality assurance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detailed Case Studies}
To better understand the system's behavior, we analyze three specific cases from the test deployment:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Success Case: "Bondi Beach Shooting" (T1).}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \emph{Input:} "{\fontencoding{T5}\selectfont Vụ xả súng tại bãi biển Bondi khiến 15 người thiệt mạng sau vụ tấn công bằng dao.}" (Bondi beach shooting kills 15 people after knife attack.)
              \item \emph{Analysis:} Despite concurrent news about "Australia Travel", the SAHC algorithm correctly isolated this event due to strong lexical overlap with "Crisis" keywords. The LLM assigned it to \textbf{T1 (Public Risk)} with high confidence (>0.9).
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Success Case: "Middle East Conflict" (T1).}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \emph{Metrics:} This cluster achieved a Semantic Consistency score of \textbf{0.96} and a Win-Rate of \textbf{0.67} against noise clusters.
              \item \emph{Insight:} The high volume of verified news anchors allowed the system to absorb social media reactions effectively without "drifting" into unrelated topics.
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Failure Analysis: "Mixed International News".}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \emph{Issue:} The algorithm merged "Vietnamese-origin lawsuit" with "Territorial conflict" into a single cluster.
              \item \emph{Root Cause:} This likely occurred due to shared diplomatic terminology (e.g., "sovereignty", "international law") acting as spurious vector anchors, bridging two semantically distinct but lexically similar topics.
              \item \emph{Detection:} Crucially, our \textbf{LLM-as-a-Judge protocol} flagged this error, assigning a low Consistency Score of \textbf{0.64} and a \textbf{0.00 Win-Rate}. This demonstrates the system's ability to automatically detect quality degradation for human review.
          \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion and Future Work}

\subsection{Challenges and Lessons Learned}
Deploying the system revealed three major technical hurdles:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Semantic Ambiguity:} Different communities use disparate terms for the same event (e.g., "Bão Yagi" vs. "Cơn bão số 3"). We addressed this using \textbf{LLM-based Deduplication} (Appendix Table \ref{tab:prompt_dedup}) and the Hybrid Matching score.
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Gap:} The lack of labeled ground truth in streaming data made validation difficult. We overcame this by establishing a \textbf{"Mini-Ground Truth"} protocol (manually labeling 300 samples) to standardize our NMI and F1 metrics.
    \item \textbf{Latency vs. Accuracy Trade-off:} Calling LLMs for every cluster introduced a 2-3s latency. We mitigated this by separating the pipeline into a \textbf{Fast Path} (Spark) for instant detection and a \textbf{Slow Path} (Async Workers) for deep analysis. Furthermore, we implemented an \textbf{Incremental Update Rule}: the LLM is only re-triggered if a cluster grows by $>20\%$ in volume, significantly reducing redundant inference costs.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Ablation Study and Component Analysis}
To quantify the contribution of each module, we conducted an ablation study by selectively disabling components (Table \ref{tab:ablation}).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{w/o News Anchors:} Removing the Slow Path dropped NMI by 20\%, confirming that social data alone is too noisy for coherent clustering.
    \item \textbf{w/o Heuristic Guard:} Disabling the initial regex filter increased the cluster count by 300\%, but most were "spam" (lottery, weather), causing a 60\% drop in F1-score.
    \item \textbf{w/o LLM Refinement:} Using raw centroids instead of LLM summaries resulted in vague event titles, reducing the interpretability score (human-eval) from 4.5 to 2.1.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Future Roadmap}
To scale the system for production use ($>10,000$ EPS), we plan to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Optimization:} Implement quantization (ONNX/Int8) for the Embedding models to reduce inference cost.
    \item \textbf{Advanced Sentiment:} Upgrade from 3-class sentiment to fine-grained emotion detection (Anger, Fear, Hope).
    \item \textbf{Feedback Loop:} Build a mechanism for users to correct cluster labels on the dashboard, feeding data back for Active Learning.
    \item \textbf{Production Scaling:} Migrate from Spark Local to a full \textbf{Kubernetes/YARN Cluster}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Ethical Considerations and Limitations}
As an AI-integrated system analyzing public discourse, we strictly adhere to ethical data practices.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Privacy Protection:} While the system processes public posts, we actively mask Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as phone numbers and specific addresses before storage to prevent misuse. All social media data is aggregated at the cluster level, ensuring no individual user is targeted.
    \item \textbf{Source Bias:} We acknowledge that our "Anchor" news sources (mainstream media) may carry inherent editorial biases. To mitigate this, the system is designed to capture "Social-Only" events (via HDBSCAN) that may be underreported by mainstream outlets.
    \item \textbf{AI Safety \& Hallucination:} Large Language Models can occasionally generate plausible but incorrect summaries. We implement a "Human-in-the-Loop" protocol for all high-risk alerts (T1-Crisis), requiring manual verification before dissemination to emergency services.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we presented a novel \textbf{Dual-Path Event Detection} framework that effectively reconciles the trade-off between real-time responsiveness and semantic depth. By decoupling latency-sensitive clustering (Fast Path) from computationally intensive LLM reasoning (Slow Path), our system achieves near-instantaneous event detection on the Fast Path (2.4s processing latency under our test setup) while maintaining strong clustering quality on the labeled Mini-Ground Truth subset (NMI 0.54; Purity 0.65) through News Anchoring. 
On the full dataset, intrinsic metrics and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation further confirm improved cluster coherence over baseline methods. We demonstrated that traditional density-based methods alone are insufficient for noisy social data, requiring a hybrid approach where confirmed news serves as a semantic stabilizer. Future work will focus on deploying quantized embedding models to edge devices and integrating multi-modal signals (images/video) to further enhance situational awareness for crisis management.
